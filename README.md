Hello!

I'm quite new to programming, but I love the idea of contributing to projects and learning at the same time.  

I've got a PhD in nutritional sciences, so I love food, research, and mentoring.  I would love to have a class where people reach their personal goals in nutrition, exercise, and relationships in order to reach the ultimate goal of living both long and well.

Now who are you?  :)
